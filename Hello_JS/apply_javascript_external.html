    <!-- below line inserts external JavaScript. 
    defer attribute, tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML content 
    once the <script> tag element has been reached. 
    -> script and the HTML will load simultaneously and the code will work

    Scripts loaded with the defer attribute will load in the ORDER they appear on the page. 
    They WON'T RUN UNTIL the page content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts 
    depend on the DOM being in place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).
    
    in comparison scripts with async attribute will execute as soon the download is done. 
    This blocks the page and does not guarantee any specific execution order. 
    Use async if the scripts should be run immediately and they DO NOT have any dependencies
