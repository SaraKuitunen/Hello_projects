    EVENTS not really part of the core JavaScript — they are defined in browser Web APIs.
    The different contexts in which JavaScript is used have different event models 
    from Web APIs to other areas such as browser WebExtensions and Node.js (server-side JavaScript).

    Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming 
    — the system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, 
    and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken 
    (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. 

    In the case of the Web, events are fired inside the browser window, 
    and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it 
    — this might be a single element, set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, 
    or the entire browser window. 
     
    There are many different types of events that can occur. For example:

    - The user selects a certain element or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
    - The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
    - The user resizes or closes the browser window.
    - A web page finishes loading.
    - A form is submitted.
    - A video is played, paused, or finishes.
    - An error occurs.

    Event reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events

    Each available event has an event handler, which is a block of code 
    (usually a JavaScript function) that runs when the event fires. 
    When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event, 
    we say we are registering an event handler. 
    Note: Event handlers are sometimes called event listeners, 
    although strictly speaking, they work together. 
    The listener listens out for the event happening, and the handler 
    is the code that is run in response to it happening.

    NOTE that event model in JavaScript for web pages differs from 
    the event model for JavaScript as it is used in other environments.
    
    For example, Node.js is a very popular JavaScript runtime that enables 
    developers to use JavaScript to build network and server-side applications. 
    The Node.js event model relies on listeners to listen for events and 
    emitters to emit events periodically. on() function registers an event listener, 
    and once() registers an event listener that unregisters after it has run once.

      const btn = document.querySelector('button');

      // btn.onclick = bgChange; // onclick property is the event handler property. when it is set to be equal to some code, that code is run when the event fires on the button.
      // btn.onfocus = bgChange; // Fires when the button is focused by pressing tab. works only in Chrome
      // btn.onblur = bgChange; // Fires when the button is unfocused by pressing tab again. works only in Chrome
      // btn.ondblclick = bgChange; 
      // window.onkeydown = bgChange; // color changes when key is pressed on keyboard. 
      // window.onkeyup = bgChange; // NOTE, event handler needs to be registered to the window object. keydown and keyup refer to just the key down and key up parts of the keystroke
      // btn.onmouseover = bgChange; // The color changes when the mouse pointer hovers over the button
      btn.onmouseout = bgChange; // The color changes when the pointer moves off the button

      /* Some events are general and available nearly anywhere 
      (e.g. an onclick handler can be registered on nearly any element), 
      whereas some are more specific and only useful in certain situations 
      (e.g. it makes sense to use onplay only on specific elements, such as <video>).
      */

      // DO NOT use inline event handlers!! Keep HTML and JavaScript separated
      // Never use the HTML event handler attributes — those are outdated, and using them is bad practice.

      // add event handler to ALL buttons on the page
      const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');
      
      for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
        buttons[i].ondblclick = bgChange;
      }      
      // NOTE, that now there's event handler for btn AND buttons and it works fine.

      // Other way to add event handler for ALL buttons. uses same 'buttons' variable as above handler
      buttons.forEach(function(buttons) {
        buttons.onmouseover = bgChange;
      });

      /***** addEventListener() – preferable method!!! *****/
      // addEventListener() method is a moder way to add event handlers
      // Note, it is ok to put all the code inside the addEventListener() function, in an anonymous function

      btn.addEventListener('click', bgChange);
      btn.addEventListener('click', btnChange);

      /* Advantages of addEventListener()

      1.
      has counterpart function: btn.removeEventListener('click', bgChange);
      Event handlers can also be removed by passing an AbortSignal to addEventListener() 
      and then, later, calling abort() on the controller owning the AbortSignal. 

      For larger programs, cleaning up old, unused event handlers can improve efficiency. 
      Plus, the ability to remove event handlers allows you to have the same button performing 
      different actions in different circumstances — all you have to do is add or remove handlers.

      2. 
      Allows you to register multiple handlers for the same listener. This is not possible on event handler properties.

      myElement.addEventListener('click', functionA);
      myElement.addEventListener('click', functionB);

      function random(number) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random()*number);
      }

      function bgChange() {
        const rndCol = 'rgb(' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ')';
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
      }

      function btnChange(e) { // e is an event object. it's automatically passed to event handlers (no need to provide as an argument in function call)
        const rndCol = 'rgb(' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ')';
        e.target.style.backgroundColor = rndCol; // The target property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon. -> here, e.target references the button
        console.log(e);
      }
      /*
      e.target is incredibly useful when you want to set the same event handler on multiple elements 
      and do something to all of them when an event occurs on them. 
      You might, for example, have a set of 16 tiles that disappear when selected. 
      It is useful to always be able to just set the thing to disappear as e.target, 
      rather than having to select it in some more difficult way.

      BUBBLING and CAPTURING

      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events

      When an event is fired on an element that has parent elements, modern browsers run three different phases 
      — the capturing phase, the target phase, and the bubbling phase.

      capturing phase: runs event handlers (if exists) from the outer-most ancestor until direct parent of the of the element that was actually selected.
      target phase: The browser checks to see if the target property has an event handler for the selected event (e.g. click) registered on it, and runs it if so.
      bubbling phase: the browser checks for and runs event handlers if they exists from the direct parent until <html> element, unless bubbles = false

      calling stopPropagation function on a handler's event object, makes it so that first handler is run 
      but the event doesn't bubble any further up the chain, so no more handlers will be run.

      what is the difference between setting e.stopPropagation(); and bubbles=false; ????

      Event delegation: thanks to bubbing, if some code is wanted to be run when when any children element is elected, 
      the event listener can be set to their parent element and have events that happen on children elements bubble up to their parent 
      rather than having to set the event listener on every child individually.
