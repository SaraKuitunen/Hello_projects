<!-- 
Function SCOPE and conflicts

The top level outside all functions is called the global scope. 
Values defined in the global scope are accessible from everywhere in the code.

variables and other things defined inside the function are inside their own separate scope, 
meaning that they are locked away in their own separate compartments, 
unreachable from code outside the functions.


Enter following command in JavaScript console:
output(x); # returns 1
output(y); # returns ReferenceError: Can't find variable: y, because it is defined inside function
output(z); # returns ReferenceError: Can't find variable: z

a_return(); # returns 2, because calls a function, which call output() function to return the value
b_return(); # returns 1, i.e. value of x

output(y); # gives an error
