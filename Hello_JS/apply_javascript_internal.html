      /* Below line and closing part "});" is an event listener, 
      which listens for the browser's "DOMContentLoaded" event, 
      which signifies that the HTML body is completely loaded and parsed. 
      The JavaScript inside this block will not run until after that event is fired, 
      therefore the error caused by JavaScript loading and parsing before HTML is avoided
      
      An old-fashioned solution to this problem used to be to put your script element right 
      at the bottom of the body (e.g. just before the </body> tag), so that it would load 
      after all the HTML has been parsed. The problem with this solution is that loading/parsing 
      of the script is completely blocked until the HTML DOM has been loaded. 
      On larger sites with lots of JavaScript, this can cause a major performance issue, 
      slowing down your site.
